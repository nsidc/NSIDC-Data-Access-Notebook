    "This notebook will walk you through how to programmatically access data from the NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC) using spatial and temporal filters, as well as how to request customization services including subsetting, reformatting, and reprojection. No Python experience is necessary; each code cell will prompt you with the information needed to configure your data request. The notebook will print the resulting API command that can be used in a command line, browser, or in Python as executed below."
